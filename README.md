A user login system with database authentication.

I took on this project to further my understanding of working with databases in Java. The program is coded in Java, and uses mySQL as the database. The simple application will check if the user is unique/new, check if the username and/or password is correct for the relevant user, and also allow the user to sign up.

I am satisfied with the overall outcome as the application works as intended and I was also able to work on my code reability, which has improved in my opinion. 

Below are images of the application.
